StarCluster is a platform to set up a SGE instance on Amazon web services.

To set up MSG on StarCluster, I followed the instructions here to create a new customized Ubuntu 12 based 64 bit AMI: http://star.mit.edu/cluster/docs/latest/manual/create_new_ami.html
On the AMI I saved host_setup.sh to /usr/local and ran it with these arguments to install MSG and all of its dependencies:
bash /usr/local/host_setup.sh /usr/local/bin /usr/local

This installs all MSG dependencies directly in /usr/local/bin which will already be on the $PATH for all potential users.  And it installed the latest version of MSG to /usr/local/msg.

I saved the AMI following the instructions in the webpage mentioned above and made the AMI public.

I modified my local .starcluster/config file to reference the new AMI id and launched StarCluster.

Other Notes:

Doing a test run:
mkdir /home/sgeadmin/MSG_test; cd /home/sgeadmin/MSG_test; ln -s /usr/local/msg; cp /usr/local/msg/example_MSG_toy/* .
perl msg/msgUpdateParentals.pl
perl msg/msgCluster.pl

Updating AMI:
Follow instructions in above mentioned webpage using the current AMI as the BASE-AMI-ID:
$ starcluster start -o -s 1 -I r3.large -m ami-14e2517c imagehost
$ starcluster listclusters --show-ssh-status imagehost
SSH in and make updates.
$ starcluster sshmaster imagehost
Save new AMI (use listclusters to get instance id)
$ starcluster ebsimage <instance id> msg-starclusterv<version>
Delete old AMI.
Update docs to reference new AMI
