Package: R.methodsS3
====================

Version: 1.2.0 [2010-03-13]
o Added a NAMESPACE.


Version: 1.1.0 [2010-01-02]
o Added getDispatchMethodS3() and findDispatchMethodsS3().


Version: 1.0.3 [2008-07-02]
o Renamed HISTORY file to NEWS.


Version: 1.0.2 [2008-05-08]
o Added getMethodS3() and getGenericS3().
o BUG FIX: isGenericS3() and isGenericS4() gave an error if 
  a function was passed.


Version: 1.0.1 [2008-03-06]
o Added paper to citation("R.methodsS3").
o BUG FIX: Regular expression pattern 'a-Z' is illegal on (at least) 
  some locale, e.g. 'C' (where 'A-z' works). The only way to specify 
  the ASCII alphabet is to list all characters explicitly, which we now
  do in all methods of the package.  See the r-devel thread 
  "invalid regular expression '[a-Z]'" on 2008-03-05 for details.


Version: 1.0.0 [2007-09-17]
o Created by extracting setMethodS3() and related methods from the 
  R.oo package.  The purpose is to provide setMethodS3() without
  having to load (the already lightweight) R.oo package.  For 
  previous history related to the methods in this package, please
  see the history of the R.oo package.
