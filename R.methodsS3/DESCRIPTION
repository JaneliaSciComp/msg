Title: Utility function for defining S3 methods
Author: Henrik Bengtsson <henrikb@braju.com>
Maintainer: Henrik Bengtsson <henrikb@braju.com>
Depends: R (>= 2.2.0)
Imports: utils
Description: Methods that simplify the setup of S3 generic functions and S3 methods.  Major effort has been made in making definition of methods as simple as possible with a
                    minimum of maintenance for package developers.  For example, generic functions are created automatically, if missing, and naming conflict are automatically
                    solved, if possible.  The method setMethodS3() is a good start for those who in the future want to migrate to S4.  This is a cross-platform package implemented
                    in pure R and generates standard S3 methods.
